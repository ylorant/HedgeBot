announceNextItem = false ; Set this to true to announce the next item on the schedule a few minutes before the current run finishes
announceNextDelay = 300 ; The amount of time before the end of the current item when the next item will be announced
refreshInterval = 300 ; Refresh interval for each schedule. That means that this time will be waited before a schedule is refreshed.
                      ; For example, if you have 5 schedules defined, with a refresh interval of 300, it'll take 300x5 = 1500s for

lookaroundThreshold = 3600 ; Threshold for broad lookaround for active schedules. This will be used when trying to fetch
                           ; active schedules with the $lookaround parameter set to true, then the schedules that are
                           ; not currently active but will be active in less than that given amount will be returned.
                           ; This is used for example by the Store to give out schedule info even before the schedule
                           ; starts, to have dependent plugins active beforehand.
earlyActionsThreshold = 600 ; Threshold to trigger early actions on schedules. This controls the delay for triggering
                            ; early measures for a schedule that is about to start, e.g. set the Twitch title and game at
                            ; the first item.
